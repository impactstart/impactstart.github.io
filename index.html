            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Impact from the Start is in the early stages of developing a nonprofit dedicated to supporting early childhood development. We focus on access to healthcare, maternal mental health resources, and caregiver education.</p>
            <p>We believe that by ensuring children receive proper medical care and their caregivers are supported, we can foster healthier futures for entire families.</p>

            <h2>Engagement & Feedback</h2>
            <p>Weâ€™re looking for passionate individuals, families, and professionals to join our movement. Whether youâ€™re a parent, educator, healthcare provider, or advocate, we want to hear from you. Share your ideas, get involved, and help us shape a future where every child has an equal opportunity to thrive. <b>Contact us to learn more or contribute to our growing initiative. ðŸ“©</b></p>

            <h2>Transparency & Growth</h2>
            <p>Weâ€™re a small, dedicated team working hard to bring this vision to life. As we grow, we appreciate your support, ideas, and patience. Your involvement will help us make a meaningful impact.</p>

            <h2>Personal Connection</h2>
            <p>Impact from the Start was created because I believe that early childhood development starts with proper healthcare and strong caregiver relationships. As someone passionate about children's well-being, I want to make sure families have the resources they needâ€”starting before birth. This mission is deeply personal, and Iâ€™m committed to making change happen.</p>
