        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>We’re a small, dedicated team working hard to bring this vision to life. As we grow, we appreciate your support, ideas, and patience. Your involvement will help us make a meaningful impact.</p>
        <p>Impact from the Start was created because I believe that early childhood development starts with proper healthcare and strong caregiver relationships. As someone passionate about children's well-being, I want to make sure families have the resources they need—starting before birth. This mission is deeply personal, and I’m committed to making change happen.</p>
